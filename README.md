# CELESTUAL

**CELESTUAL** — *"does your ex still think about you?"* — is an anonymous,
reciprocal matching site. Live at **https://celestual.us/**.

You enter your Instagram @ and your ex's @. You only find out it's mutual if
**they** independently enter **you** — anonymous, zero-rejection. One-sided
entries are never revealed to anyone.

It's a Vite + React single-page app talking directly to **Supabase** (Postgres
RPCs + edge functions); there is no separate app server.

Everything — tables, RPCs, edge functions, env vars — is named `celestual` /
`celestual_*`. There is no longer any `celeste` or `still` codename.

## Quick start (local dev)

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev          # demo mode (no backend): enter @demo as the ex to see a match
```

Without Supabase env vars the app runs fully in **demo mode**. To talk to a real
backend, copy `app/.env.example` to `app/.env.local` and paste your Supabase URL +
anon key.

## Build

```bash
npm run build        # from repo root → CELESTUAL into dist/
```

`vercel.json` serves `dist/` at the root.

## Going live

The whole manual setup — domain, Supabase, Vercel, email, optional sign-in — is
in **[docs/GO-LIVE.md](./docs/GO-LIVE.md)**. Start there. There is no paywall;
every star is free, gated only by a server-side weekly slot budget.
